## 🌟 **About the Project**

🚀 The **Auto-Redaction Web App** is a state-of-the-art tool that allows users to **automatically redact sensitive information** in PDFs and images securely and efficiently. This tool utilizes **OCR technology** and **AI-based models** to ensure **privacy protection**, leveraging in-memory data processing to provide maximum security.

✨ **Key Highlights:**

- **Text Extraction**: Powered by **PyPDF**, **OpenCV**, and **EasyOCR** to handle various formats.
- **Data Detection**: Implemented using **Presidio Analyzer** and **PyTourch** to identify and redact sensitive data.
- **In-Memory Processing**: All operations occur in memory, ensuring no sensitive data is stored during processing.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **Streamlit**, the app provides an intuitive interface with easy file upload and download options.
